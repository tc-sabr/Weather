# Weather Analysis

Trend #1
Looking at the Latitude vs. Temperature scatter plot, the temperature increases as the latitude approaches zero.

Trend #2
Looking at the Latitude vs. Wind Speed scatter plot, there is a point that shows a wind speed around 100 mph around latitude 0. There is most likely a storm at that location.

Trend #3
Looking at all the scatter plots, a majority of the points appear to be located between 0 and 90 degrees latitude. Further investigation should be done to confirm if the proportion of the sample cities matches the population proportion.
